    <h2 class="welcome">   WELCOME TO THE VR WORLD  </h2>

<h4 class="intro">Introduction </h4>
  <p> Virtual Reality (VR) is the use of computer technology to create a simulated environment. Unlike traditional user interfaces,
    VR places the user inside an experience. Instead of viewing a screen in front of them, users are immersed and able to interact with 3D worlds. 
    By simulating as many senses as possible, such as vision, hearing, touch, even smell, the computer is transformed into a gatekeeper to this artificial world.
    The only limits to near-real VR experiences are the availability of content and cheap computing power.
    </p>

    <h4 class="vrt"> Virtual reality technology</h4>
    
    <p> Virtual Reality most immediately-recognizable component is the head-mounted display (HMD). Human beings are visual creatures,
        and display technology is often the single biggest difference between immersive Virtual Reality systems and traditional user interfaces.
        For instance, CAVE automatic virtual environments actively display virtual content onto room-sized screens. While they are fun for people in universities and big labs, 
        onsumer and industrial wearables are the wild west.
        With a multiplicity of emerging hardware and software options, the future of wearables is unfolding but yet unknown. Concepts such as the HTC Vive Pro Eye, Oculus Quest and Playstation VR are leading the way, but there are also players like Google, Apple, Samsung, Lenovo and others who may surprise the industry with new levels of immersion and usability. Whomever comes out ahead, the simplicity of buying a helmet-sized device that can work in a living-room, 
        office, or factory floor has made HMDs center stage when it comes to Virtual Reality technologies.</p>

<h4 class="hr"> The history of VR </h4> 

<p> The current life cycle of virtual reality may have begun when the earliest prototypes of the Oculus Rift showed up at the E3 videogame trade show in 2012,
     but it’s been licking at the edges of our collective consciousness for more than a century.The idea of immersing ourselves in 3D environments dates all the way back to the stereoscopes that captivated people's imaginations in the 19th century.
    If you present an almost identical image to each eye, your brain will combine them and find depth in their discrepancies;
    it's the same mechanism View-Masters used to become a childhood staple.When actual VR took root in our minds as an all-encompassing simulacrum is a little fuzzier. As with most technological breakthroughs, the vision likely began with science fiction—specifically Stanley G. Weinbaum’s 1935 short story “Pygmalion’s Spectacles,” in which a scientist devises a pair of glasses that can "make it so that you are in the story, you speak to the shadows, and the shadows reply, 
    and instead of being on a screen, the story is all about you, and you are in it."</p>
