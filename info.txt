Horizon World VR Metaverse

Facebook has been in existence since February of 2004. On October 28th, 2021, itâ€™s founder Mark Zuckerberg 
announced that he would be rebranding Facebook to Meta Platforms Inc. or Meta for short. As part of this reveal, 
the Horizon World VR Metaverse was announced. Meta first showed their interest in virtual reality in 2014, when 
they acquired Oculus - a leading VR headset company. This endeavor set the stage for their Metaverse. Users will 
interact in their Metaverse through VR headsets and personalized avatars. Meta seeks to break barriers in the 
workplace, travel and entertainment.


HP Reverb H2 Omnicept 

Hewlett-Packard, or HP for short, was founded in September of 1998. They are primarily known for their 
laptops, desktops and printers. HP continues to successfully generate the returns from the sale of these 
products, making them one of the major tech companies in the world today. In November 2020, they ventured 
into the world of virtual reality. The HP Reverb headset was their first product in the VR field. Shortly 
thereafter, HP released an upgraded headset to the public. This was called HP Reverb G2 Omnicept Edition. 
With this new and improved headset, a  user can track their biometric data and utilize this information to 
better tend to their needs. Alongside this release was a VR backpack which allows virtual reality to be more 
portable. Having such features opens up more opportunities for VR to be used.
